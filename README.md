# **Student Loans Recommendation System using Deep Learning**  

## **Overview**  
This project implements a deep learning-based recommendation system for student loans. The goal is to provide personalized loan recommendations to students based on their financial situation, loan preferences, and eligibility criteria.  

## **Features**  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares student and loan data for model training.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts key attributes to improve recommendation accuracy.  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes neural networks to predict the best loan options.  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.  

## **Installation & Requirements**  
To run this notebook, install the required dependencies using:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Ensure that you generate a `requirements.txt` file if necessary.)  

## **Usage**  
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells step by step to preprocess data, train the model, and generate recommendations.  

## **Dataset**  
The model uses student financial data, loan options, and eligibility criteria. Ensure that the dataset is correctly loaded in the notebook before running the code.  

## **Challenges & Considerations**  
- **Data Privacy & Security:** Sensitive financial information must be handled securely.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** The system should align with lending policies and legal requirements.  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Integrate real-time interest rate updates.  
- Enhance model interpretability for better transparency.  
- Optimize performance with alternative deep learning architectures.
